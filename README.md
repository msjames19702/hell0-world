# hello-world
This is my first github repository. I've recently bought a Raspberry Pi 3 and plan to keep initial setup, config and progress notes in a new repository I'll create. For example, how I formatted a new 64GB microSD card in the required MS-DOS FAT32 format or how I got audio to pipe thru the HDMI, or how I configured my Pi to connect to my home WiFi, etc. Another repository may track a PYTHON programming project I develop on my Pi or using PyCharm on my Mac.
